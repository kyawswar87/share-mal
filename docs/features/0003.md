# Feature 0003: Jest Testing Framework Integration

## Brief Description

Add Jest testing framework to the React frontend application to enable comprehensive unit testing, component testing, and integration testing. The current frontend uses Create React App which includes Jest by default, but lacks proper test configuration, test utilities, and actual test implementations.

## Technical Requirements

### Current State Analysis
- Frontend uses Create React App with React 18.2.0 and TypeScript 4.9.5
- Jest is already included via `react-scripts` but not properly configured
- No existing test files in the `src/` directory
- Components include: App.tsx, BillForm.tsx, BillList.tsx, PersonList.tsx, BillCard.tsx, SearchBar.tsx
- Services include: billApi.ts with API calls to backend
- Types defined in types/index.ts
- Uses React Hook Form, React Bootstrap, and Axios

### Files and Functions to be Modified/Created

#### Configuration Files
- `frontend/package.json` - Add Jest configuration and testing dependencies
- `frontend/jest.config.js` - Create Jest configuration file
- `frontend/src/setupTests.ts` - Create test setup file for global test configuration

#### Test Utilities
- `frontend/src/test-utils/test-utils.tsx` - Create custom render function with providers
- `frontend/src/test-utils/mock-data.ts` - Create mock data for testing
- `frontend/src/test-utils/mock-handlers.ts` - Create MSW mock handlers for API testing

#### Component Tests
- `frontend/src/App.test.tsx` - Test main App component functionality
- `frontend/src/components/BillForm.test.tsx` - Test bill creation/editing form
- `frontend/src/components/BillList.test.tsx` - Test bill listing and filtering
- `frontend/src/components/BillCard.test.tsx` - Test individual bill card display
- `frontend/src/components/PersonList.test.tsx` - Test person list and payment status
- `frontend/src/components/SearchBar.test.tsx` - Test search functionality

#### Service Tests
- `frontend/src/services/billApi.test.ts` - Test API service methods

#### Integration Tests
- `frontend/src/integration/bill-crud.test.tsx` - Test complete bill CRUD workflow
- `frontend/src/integration/payment-flow.test.tsx` - Test payment status updates

### Dependencies to Add

#### Testing Libraries
- `@testing-library/react` - React component testing utilities
- `@testing-library/jest-dom` - Custom Jest matchers for DOM testing
- `@testing-library/user-event` - User interaction simulation
- `@testing-library/react-hooks` - React hooks testing utilities
- `msw` - Mock Service Worker for API mocking
- `jest-environment-jsdom` - JSDOM environment for Jest

#### Type Definitions
- `@types/jest` - Jest type definitions
- `@types/testing-library__jest-dom` - Testing library Jest DOM types

### Jest Configuration Details

#### Core Configuration
- Set up JSDOM environment for DOM testing
- Configure module name mapping for absolute imports
- Set up test file patterns and coverage thresholds
- Configure transform for TypeScript and CSS modules
- Set up global test setup and teardown

#### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% line coverage
- Minimum 70% branch coverage
- Minimum 80% function coverage
- Minimum 80% statement coverage

#### Test Environment Setup
- Configure MSW for API mocking
- Set up React Testing Library with custom render
- Configure global test utilities and matchers
- Set up mock data and handlers

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- Test individual component rendering and props
- Test form validation and user interactions
- Test utility functions and data transformations
- Test API service methods with mocked responses

#### Component Tests
- Test component state management
- Test event handlers and callbacks
- Test conditional rendering based on props/state
- Test form submission and validation

#### Integration Tests
- Test complete user workflows (create bill, edit bill, delete bill)
- Test API integration with mocked responses
- Test navigation and routing
- Test error handling and loading states

### Mock Strategy

#### API Mocking
- Use MSW to intercept HTTP requests
- Create mock handlers for all API endpoints
- Mock both success and error responses
- Mock different data scenarios (empty lists, large datasets)

#### Component Mocking
- Mock external dependencies (React Router, Bootstrap components)
- Mock complex child components when testing parent components
- Use shallow rendering for isolated component testing

### Test Data Management

#### Mock Data Structure
- Create realistic mock data matching API response structure
- Include edge cases (empty data, large datasets, special characters)
- Create factory functions for generating test data
- Maintain consistency between mock data and actual API responses

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. Install and configure Jest and testing dependencies
2. Create Jest configuration file
3. Set up test utilities and global configuration
4. Create mock data and API handlers

#### Phase 2: Component Testing
1. Write tests for individual components (BillCard, SearchBar, PersonList)
2. Write tests for complex components (BillForm, BillList)
3. Write tests for main App component

#### Phase 3: Service and Integration Testing
1. Write tests for API service methods
2. Write integration tests for complete workflows
3. Set up coverage reporting and CI integration

### Quality Gates

#### Test Coverage
- Achieve minimum coverage thresholds
- Ensure all critical business logic is tested
- Test error handling and edge cases

#### Test Quality
- Tests should be maintainable and readable
- Tests should be independent and not rely on external state
- Tests should run quickly and reliably
- Tests should provide clear failure messages

### CI/CD Integration

#### GitHub Actions
- Add test step to existing CI pipeline
- Generate and upload coverage reports
- Fail builds on coverage threshold violations
- Run tests on multiple Node.js versions

#### Coverage Reporting
- Generate HTML coverage reports
- Upload coverage to Codecov or similar service
- Set up coverage badges in README
- Configure coverage thresholds in CI
